# Emotion-Prediction

To create an emotion prediction model using text data, I analyzed various datasets and applied techniques like sentiment analysis and natural language processing. After training the model to recognize emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and others based on text inputs, I proceeded to deploy it. Deployment involved setting up the model to run on a server or cloud platform, ensuring it can receive text inputs from users and provide accurate emotion predictions in real-time. 

This project aimed to enhance understanding of emotional cues in text and demonstrate practical application of data science in analyzing human emotions through digital communication.
